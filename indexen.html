    <h1>Zen Family</h1>
    <p>
    
I introduce myself, Tiphaine, I work in the medico-social sector and my tender spouse in Web development. To fill us we have 2 adorable female monsters!
Chick 9 years old and Chouquette 3 years old (these are first names ;-)) a dog, Jack, and two rabbits. Our days are dense and rhythmic work, metro, sleep this expression made sense when the arrival of our first ... We complain very often the short time we have with our children, the stress of work, the time passing by ... What causes an impact on our quality of life: little patience, shouting, nervousness ... which in the end make us feel guilty! I have no miracle recipe I have not stopped working, it is even very addictive but our way of seeing things changed our daily life that we led before ...
So before what? Why this change in our life?
The announcement of the disease has changed our life and our way of seeing things. Poussin was 6 years old at that time and Chouquette barely 8 months old, I would say that there was less impact on Chouquette, she bathes since her age in it. While Poussin more complicated, it is necessary to put words on the emotions, on what is happening, on this physical degradation, on these round-trip doctor ... But of an optimistic naturalness, we go there, we go ...
Things have come naturally! By coming here you will find small tips that I practice daily to improve our quality of life and especially to reach those emotions that overwhelm us at any time, which can be destabilizing for oneself or for the entourage .... But all this would not have been possible without the help of my friend Elise who after several years without seeing each other and reappeared when we needed it the most with "his magic wand". Nanny basic, she became a therapist in the broad sense because she has plenty of power! and his help was precious at that time, he is still but we learned to manage alone and make discoveries for a better life! To you to test, to judge what suits you and why not share your experiences ... Come come with me it's here!

    <p>These flowers are fantastic especially with the accompaniment of a good therapist. These are floral elixirs that act at every negative psychological state!
The whole family at his little jar even Jack! They are personalized, composed according to our emotions to be treated. To make the composition, it is necessary to go through an "inventory" of your emotions then we choose the flowers that correspond! And on the road, we are preparing the flowers and a double daily dose.
The results are surprising! I noticed an improvement on the management of emotions on Poussin, she was anxious, stressed by the events she had experienced in recent months. She will not miss for anything in the world her consultation! Moreover, it is she who chooses her flowers always according to the emotions of the moment!
